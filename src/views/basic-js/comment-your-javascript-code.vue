          <h1>Comment Your Js Code</h1>
          <p>
            Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally
            ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to
            other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.
          </p>
          <p>There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:</p>
          <p>
            Using <Code>//</Code> will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder
            of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:
          </p>
          <Comment>// This is an in-line comment.</Comment>
          <p>
            You can make a multi-line comment beginning with <Code>/*</Code> and
            ending with <Code>*/</Code>. This is a multi-line comment:
          </p>
          <Comment>/* This is a multi-line comment */</Comment>
          <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b> As you write code, you should regularly add comments to
            clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help
            communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your
            future self.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>Try creating one of each type of comment.</p>

                You should create a <Code>//</Code> style comment that contains
                at least five letters.

              <p>
                You should create a <Code>/* */</Code> style comment that
                contains at least five letters.
