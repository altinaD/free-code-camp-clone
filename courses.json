      "description": "JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.\n\n In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.",

      "title": "ES6",
      "description": "ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.\n\n Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.\n\n ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.\n\n",

      "title": "Regular Expressions",
      "description": "Regular expressions, often shortened to 'regex' or 'regexp', are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches.\n\n In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.",

      "title": "Debugging",
      "description": "Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.\n\n Issues in code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.\n\n In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen.",

You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access and manipulate data."

      "title": "Basic Algorithm Scripting",
      "description": "An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.\n\n To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.\n\n In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.",

In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.\n\n In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter().",
