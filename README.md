This is a clone of some part of the FreeCodeCamp bootcamp site, specifically freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures part. Please use this link, because freecodecamp.org has some updates(beta versions). You should provide internet connection to see all capabilities (fonts and monaco-editor are loaded via cdn)

Each lesson of sections is a vue component, saved in view directory. Made with VueRouter4,createWebHashHistory, lazy loading.
Data is saved in courses.json, and imported with a mock server (json server).

Note: not all components are imported, just for demo purposes some of them are used.

Issues: 1. Each component of courses has a scroll bar, which I was not able to remove. 2. the user code in each component cannot be validated. 3. need code automation inside views folder.

PS I know that this is not the best solution for this project, nevertheless I believe that if there is a person who can guide me I am definitelyÂ going to write code better. FYI I am open to learning new things, and so excited to be part of the development world. Looking forward for your response)
